    "Here's the scoop:\n",

    "The python class `OpenAI` is simply code written by OpenAI engineers that makes calls over the internet to an endpoint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `openai.chat.completions.create()`, this python code just makes a web request to the following url: \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Code like this is known as a \"client library\" - it's just wrapper code that runs on your machine to make web requests. The actual power of GPT is running on OpenAI's cloud behind this API, not on your computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI was so popular, that lots of other AI providers provided identical web endpoints, so you could use the same approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Ollama has an endpoint running on your local box at http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions  \n",
    "And in week 2 we'll discover that lots of other providers do this too, including Gemini and DeepSeek.\n",

      "Okay, I need to understand the definitions of several key terms related to Large Language Models (LLMs). The user asked for definitions of \"neural network,\" \"attention,\" and the \"transformer.\" Let's take each one step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with Neural Networks: I remember that neural networks are a type of machine learning model. They're composed of layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, which process information. Each neuron receives input from other neurons, processes it using an activation function to compute an output value, and passes the result on to the next layer. The key point is how these connections learn through training.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next is attention. From what I know, attention allows models to focus on specific parts of the text or data when making a prediction. It's about assigning weights or probabilities to different positions in the input sequence. This helps the model attend to more relevant information for generating responses effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the Transformer itself. Transformers are a type of neural network architecture introduced by Vaswani et al. I recall that they have a unique structure with self-attention mechanisms within each layer, as opposed to the sequential processing done in recurrent networks like LSTMs or GRUs. Each model instance consists of multiple layers, and at each step within these layers, attention is computed using scaled dot product attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, neural networks are the general class of models composed of interconnected layers with activation functions. Attention is a feature that helps models focus on important parts of their input by assigning weights to them. The transformer architecture uses self-attention internally in each layer and processes inputs sequentially without relying on previous steps.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "**Definitions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Neural Network:** A neural network is a computational system designed to recognize patterns, typically within data, by processing input through layers of weighted connections (or neurons) that use non-linear activation functions to compute output values.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Attention:** Attention allows models to focus on specific elements of their input during computation, enabling them to pay attention to relevant data points, which is crucial for effective text generation and other tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Transformer:** A Transformer model incorporates self-attention mechanisms within each layer, allowing it to process inputs in a sequence without relying on previous layers, distinct from the sequential processing used by RNN-based models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) or Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (GRUs). This design enhances its ability to process long-range dependencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- Neural networks are neural network architectures composed of interconnected layers with activation functions.\n",
      "- Attention facilitates focusing on relevant parts of input data by assigning weights.\n",
      "- The Transformer architecture uses self-attention within each layer and processes inputs sequentially without prior contextual dependence.\n"
