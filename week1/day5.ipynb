We help recruiters source, understand, engage and manage talent, using Generative AI and other forms of machine learning. Our\\npatented\\nmodel matches people with roles with greater accuracy and speed than previously imaginable — no keywords required. Take a look for yourself; it’s completely free to try.\\nOur long term goal is to help people discover their potential and pursue their reason for being, motivated by a concept called\\nIkigai\\n. We help people find roles where they will be most fulfilled and successful; as a result, we will raise the level of human prosperity. It sounds grandiose, but since 77% of people don’t consider themselves\\ninspired or engaged\\nat work, it’s completely within our reach.\\nI sometimes have to pinch myself. I’m incredibly lucky to be working in the field of AI at a time when it’s rewriting the boundaries of human and tech possibilities. I’m personally most drawn to applying AI to real world problems, and the specific problem of hiring has plagued me throughout my career. So I’m in the business of finding people their dream jobs — and conveniently, I’m in my dream job myself.\\nBefore Nebula.io\\nYou can trace the roots of Nebula.io to an AI startup I founded in 2013 called\\nuntapt\\n. We built talent marketplaces and data science software for recruitment firms. To start with, we specialized on tech roles in financial services, where there was a huge supply/demand gap.\\nWe were selected to be part of a prestigious accelerator program – the\\nAccenture FinTech Innovation Lab\\n– and we were an\\nAmerican Banker Top 20 Company To Watch\\n. We were covered in\\nFast Company\\n,\\nForbes\\nand\\nAmerican Banker\\n, and I was interviewed on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq:\\nAfter a 20 year career in Financial Services, the most rewarding thing to me about untapt was that we were tackling\\ntangible real-world problems\\nfaced by everyone. I loved that we had billboard ads in train stations and we got to speak to our end-users every day. One of my proudest moments: at an Amazon pitch event to people in tech, we were voted the ‘startup most likely to grow exponentially’.\\nAnd then, our path to exponential growth was accelerated suddenly and wonderfully. Our top client, recruitment powerhouse GQR, was interested in a deeper partnership. In 2021 untapt was\\nacquired\\nby GQR’s parent company, and shortly afterwards, Nebula.io was born.\\nMy request to you\\nMy New Year’s Resolution is to do a better job of networking. That’s where you come in. If any of this sounds interesting, please\\nconnect with me\\nfor a virtual coffee. Or even a real coffee, if you’re in NYC.\\nI have broad expertise that spans software engineering, data science, technology leadership, entrepreneurship, and anything made by Apple. My notable prowess in these areas is only surpassed by my inability to perform anything requiring hand/eye coordination. Do not be fooled by my final pictures: if you’re looking for someone to join your Amazing Race team, or your America’s Got Talen'"
